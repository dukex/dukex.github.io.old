This was a personal project, my initial idea was to put in the same website all events happening in Augusta Street (a very famous street because of its underground night clubs and bars in SÃ£o Paulo). In the first version, I used ruby on rails and jquery mobile. After I splat the project in mobile version and desktop version, I ditched jquery mobile and started to use Backbone.js. The project consisted of web crawlers to watch the night clubs websites and gather the data to populate a database. I made this project solo, from the backend to the design/frontend.
