This project started with a old-idea, when I was young I loved a app called Mixman(a small and simple DJ app). One day I tried create this app with HTML5, after some code lines I thought this project can be a MPC instead of a simple Mixman copy. The working is in progress. I'm using only javascript code and one html page

Mixboy is open source and the you can found code on github [github.com/dukex/mixboy](https://github.com/dukex/mixboy)
